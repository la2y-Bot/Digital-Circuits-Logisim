# Digital Circuits with Logisim

A collection of digital circuits built using **Logisim** as part of my learning journey in digital logic design.  
This repository includes basic gates, combinational and sequential circuits, and small projects like adders, counters, and a simple CPU.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install Logisim**  
   - Download Logisim from [Logisim official site](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/).  
   - Open `.circ` files directly in Logisim.

2. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Digital-Circuits-Logisim.git
   cd Digital-Circuits-Logisim```
3. 	Explore Circuits
• 	Navigate to folders and open  files in Logisim.
• 	Each circuit is documented with explanations in Markdown files

##📖 Contents
- Basics: AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR gates with truth tables.
- Combinational Circuits: Half Adder, Full Adder, Multiplexer, Decoder.
- Sequential Circuits: SR Latch, D Flip-Flop, JK Flip-Flop, Counters.
- Projects: ALU, Simple CPU, Traffic Light Controller.

##🎯 Goals
- Build a structured library of digital circuits for learning and practice.
- Document each circuit with explanations and screenshots.
- Extend the repo with Verilog/SystemVerilog implementations for FPGA prototyping.
- Showcase practical skills in digital design and verification
